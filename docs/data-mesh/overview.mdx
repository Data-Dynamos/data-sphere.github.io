# What is Data Mesh? (Optional)

> “Data mesh is a decentralized sociotechnical approach to share, access, and manage analytical data in complex and large-scale
 environments—within or across organizations.”

-- Zhamak Dehghani


Data Mesh calls for a multi-dimensional shift, both technically, and organisationally. It moves the organisation from centralised 
ownership to decentralised ownership along domain boundaries. It shifts the architecture from a monolithic data system, to a distributed 
set of analytical products. Technically it takes teams from treating their data as a side-effect or byproduct, to treating the data as a 
first class citizen and product. It pushes for an operational shift from top-down governance to federated and computational governance. It 
moves from the principal of having data as a thing to collect and store, to data as a product to share, connect, and evolve. 

## The Data Mesh approach

The approach aims to address some of these issues through the application of the following four principles:
- [Domain-driven ownership of data](#principle-1)
- [Treating data as a product](#principle-2)
- [Enabling data owners with a self-serve data platform](#principle-3)
- [Federated, computational data governance](#principle-4)

### Domain-driven ownership of data

Data should be managed close to its source of origin. Data Mesh achieves this through a distributed domain driven
architecture which aligns data with the domain boundaries of an organisation.  This allows us to scale, by moving 
away from monolithic analytical architectures / team structures which can become a bottleneck, and close the gap
between data producers and their consumers. It also helps to establish proper ownership and accountability for data.

In a traditional setup, we might expect to see an organisation segment their operational and analytical spaces quite
rigigly. Unfortunately this ends up creating a centralised (and monolithic) central analytics function. Instead of 
having systems and data segmented along domain boundaries, a centralised approach causes friction where teams are 
siloed (e.g. a central analytics team).

### Treating data as a product

The architectural quantum within the data mesh. this is the smallest unit of architecture that can be independently deployed
with high functional cohesion and containing all of the elements required for it to function. 

A data product provides a representation of analytical data served for a particular 
purpose within the analytical plane. Ownership exists within the domain, and so the same teams that own the operational systems that 
produce the data, are also responsible for this analytical product bringing their data into the Data Mesh. 
As with any other product, a data product should be **usable**, **valuable**, and **feasible**. 

For a data product to be useable, it should be:
- discoverable
- understandable
- trustworthy
- secure
- re-usable
- interoperable
- accessible

For it to be valuable, we should ensure that the product meets a real business need. "Data product" should not be conflated with "data set".

### Data Mesh platform

If we want to treat data as a product, and allow teams to not only produce data but also create and own this new type of analytical
data products - then we need to put the constructs in place to empower those teams, and reduce the cost of ownership and risk of
re-inventing the wheel between domains. Providing a platform through which teams can self-serve their data products will also allow
some of the standards and computational governance to be baked into any of the data products being brought into the Data Mesh. 

The Data Mesh platform will provide standardised tooling and domain agnostic capabilities for data products. 
This will allow for the onboarding of products, allowing for the exchange of value between producers and consumers through a defined 
set of interfaces (in the data product). It can also provide the guard rails to ensure that the data products develop in a 
standardised manner, thereby enabling interoperability, consistency, reduced complexity.

### Federated, computational data governance

Data Mesh is decentralised at its core. There is however a need for us to have certain policies and structures in place to guide the
evolution of the decentralised system, and ensure that particular standards are met. Governance in the Data Mesh however moves from policies
being defined in isolation, but rather build the policies needed into the data products and platform where possible. This federated and computational
governance will ensure consistent and reliable enforcement of policies across the Data Mesh ecosystem, and enable higher order value by allowing
data products to interoperate effectively.
