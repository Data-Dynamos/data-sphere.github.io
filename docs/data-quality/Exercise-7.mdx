# Exercise 7


#### To create singular test to validate `uniqueness check` on `Year` column in `europe_big_three_emissions` model

Follow the instructions below using DBT:

1. Open your dbt project and navigate to the tests folder.

2. Create a new file called `assert_unique_check_europe_big_three_emissions.sql` or any suitable name for the singular test file.

3. In the file, define the query to check whether the `Year` column is unique in `europe_big_three_emissions` view.

4. Specify the view name in the query by referencing the `europe_big_three_emissions` view. You can use the `ref()` function to refer to the view. For example, `FROM {{ ref('europe_big_three_emissions') }}`.

5. Define the query in such a way that it should result output if `year` column has duplicates.

6. Save the file.

7. Run the dbt test project to validate the result. You can use the `dbt test` command in your terminal to see if test case is successfully completed.
