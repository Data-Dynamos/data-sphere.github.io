# Exercise 2


#### To create singular test to validate `format check` on `Year` column in `aggregate_global_temperatures` model

Follow the instructions below using DBT:

1. Open your dbt project and navigate to the tests folder.

2. Create a new file called `assert_year_format_aggregate_global_temperatures.sql` or any suitable name for the singular test file.

3. In the file, define the query to check whether the `year` column is in YYYY format in `aggregate_global_emissions` view.

4. Specify the view name in the query by referencing the `aggregate_global_temperatures` view. You can use the `ref()` function to refer to the view. For example, `FROM {{ ref('aggregate_global_temperatures') }}`.

5. Define the query in such a way that it should result output if any row has format other than YYYY format in `year` column.

6. Save the file.

7. Run the dbt test project to validate the result. You can use the `dbt test` command in your terminal to see if test case is successfully completed.
