# Exercise 5


#### To create singular test to validate `consistency check` on `Country` column in `aggregate_country_emissions_temperatures` model

Follow the instructions below using DBT:

1. Open your dbt project and navigate to the tests folder.

2. Create a new file called `assert_initcap_aggregate_country_emissions_temperatures.sql` or any suitable name for the singular test file.

3. In the file, define the query to check whether the `country` column is in InitCap format in `aggregate_country_emissions_temperatures` table.

4. Specify the table name in the query by referencing the `aggregate_country_emissions_temperatures` table. You can use the `ref()` function to refer to the table. For example, `FROM {{ ref('aggregate_country_emissions_temperatures') }}`.

5. Define the query in such a way that it should result output if any row has `country` column other than InitCap format.

6. Save the file.

7. Run the dbt test project to validate the result. You can use the `dbt test` command in your terminal to see if test case is successfully completed.
