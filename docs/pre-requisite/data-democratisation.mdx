Please note: Completing these courses in detail is not required. Skimming through the content to grasp the fundamentals is sufficient, and you're encouraged to skip sections that you're already familiar with. More importantly, it's entirely acceptable to skip entire courses if you feel confident in the basics; the key is to familiarize yourself with Databricks and Spark, which will be our primary tools.
