# Reflect
When thinking about Security & Privacy we should ask ourselves the questions:
<details><summary>What is sensitive information?</summary>
3 categories
    <li>Personally Identifiable information (PII) link to person</li>
    <li>Person-Related information</li>
    <li>Confidential information - can contain personal information</li>
</details>

<details><summary>Why do we care about sensitive information?</summary>
Compliance, regulation, and most importantly, people's humanity.
</details>
