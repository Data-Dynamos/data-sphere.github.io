This reduces the need to data wranglers in an organisation from solving the same problem over again (curation) and there is a consistent definition for whether or not a domain object is in a certain state (e.g. what features contribute to healthy/not-healthy).

For example: not all sensor data is human-readable and might come in a binary format which is required to be de-coded by a manufacturer-specific translation mapping, of which there are many.
